# Pacfully-Webpage
This was my first work during my internship, where I successfully developed and completed three responsive web pages for the project titled "Pacfully" using HTML5 and CSS3. The goal was to build user-friendly, mobile-responsive interfaces aligned with modern web development standards and best practices.
