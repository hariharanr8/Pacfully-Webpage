# Pacfully-Webpage
This was my first work during my internship, where I successfully developed and completed three responsive web pages for the project titled "Pacfully" using HTML5 and CSS3. The goal was to build user-friendly, mobile-responsive interfaces aligned with modern web development standards and best practices.
## Key Contributions:
  - Developed structured layouts using #HTML5 and styled components with #CSS3 to create clean and modern UI designs.
  - Implemented responsive features using #MediaQueries, #Flexbox, and #GridLayout to ensure adaptability across screen sizes.
  - Designed reusable UI elements such as #NavigationBars and #FooterLayouts.
## Responsive Design Implementation
In the Pacfully project, I implemented a responsive web design approach to ensure the layout and user experience adapt seamlessly across various devices including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. This was achieved using CSS media queries, flexbox, and grid layouts.
- I used media queries to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes:
  
        ### Mobile Devices (up to 480px):
        The layout switches to a single-column structure to fit small screens. Elements are stacked vertically with optimized text size and spacing for readability and touch interaction.
        
        ### Tablet Devices (481px to 768px):
        The layout adjusts to a two-column structure where appropriate. Font sizes, padding, and images scale proportionally to offer a better viewing experience on medium-sized screens.
        
        ### Laptop/Desktop Devices (769px and above):
        The full layout is displayed with multi-column arrangements using flexbox or grid. Larger fonts, wider spacing, and full navigation bars are shown to utilize the available screen space.
        
        This responsive behavior ensures that the website remains user-friendly and visually consistent across all screen types.
